# About
Really haven't tried to write a **BLOG** for such a long time, approximately 6 years (here I mean a real blog with content, not some sudden enthusiam).  
Well, pages could be vary. Random thoughts, learning materials, favourite images, all can be present on the site.  
I must admit that I also have fallen for the convenience of pre-made templates. Yeah, why not adapt from other's smooth design.  
Haha, hopefully I consider myself still possess some creativity.
